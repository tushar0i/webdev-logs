# State management using React-Redux

## About Redux 
 - redux is a state management library for javascript application 
 - react-redux is a library that work as a bridge between react and redux 
 - It help us to manage the state of the app it redces the number of rerenders in the app which is a important thing

### the idea is to learn Redux so i thought to make a simple app that has items and we can add multiple items and it will give the bill summary 

 1. created a store which contains store.js and all the slices in my case cartSlice.js
 2. created components for the app itemsList and billSummary
 3. wrap the main app component in provider which includes the store in it.
 4. create the initialState of the app in cartSlice.js
 5. created a cart Slice in cartSlice.js with all the essential reducers(functions)

Honestly saying I was following harkirat cohort 2.0 and I we at state management(recoil) lecture but my code was not working then I found our that meta has archived the project so I started learning redux.
